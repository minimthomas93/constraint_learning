## 📌 Project Description

 This project is to implement a program that learns constraints from a provided set of positive and negative sample inputs. Once learned, the constraints can be used to
 check whether a given input satisfies them and to generate inputs that satisfy them (or: do not satisfy them if desired).
 
 Learning such input constraints has applications in:
   Program testing: Finding the conditions under which an input is accepted by an
   input validation component, which allows to fuzz deeper.
   Program repair: Finding the conditions under which an input triggers a bug
